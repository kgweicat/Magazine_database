# Magazine_database
This program uses a doubly-linked list to create a magazine database.

I constructed my own generic LinkedList class using a doubly-linked list, and used my LinkedList to create a driver file that is able to store details of magazines.

I constructed an interface (IDedObject) and a class (Magazine) which implements IDedObject.

The LinkedList I created allows the user to do the following: 
 - insert new item as first item in list
 - delete first item
 - delete designated item
 - print all items
 - delete all items
 - search for specific item
