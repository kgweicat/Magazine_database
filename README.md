# Magazine_database
Java project, using doubly-linked-list to create a magazine database

I created my own generic LinkedList class using a doubly-linked list, and use my LinkedList to create a driver file that is able to store details of magazines.

I create the magazine class, which implements the IDObject interface.

The LinkedList I created allows the user to do the following: 
 - insert item at front
 - delete the first item
 - delete a designated item
 - print all items
 - delete all items
 - search for a certain item
